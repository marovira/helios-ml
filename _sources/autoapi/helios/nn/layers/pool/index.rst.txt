Module Contents

.. py:class:: AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size: int | tuple[int | None, int | None])

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`


   Applies a 2D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several input planes.

   The output is of size :math:`H \times W`, for any input size. The number of output
   features is equal to the number of input planes.

   .. note::
       This class is a re-implementation of ``torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`` that can be
       exported to ONNX and serves as a drop-in replacement for torch's version.

   :param output_size: the target output size of the image of the form :math:`H \times W`.
                       Can be a tuple ``(H, W)`` or a single ``H`` for a square image :math:`H \times
                       H`. ``H`` and ``W`` can be either a ``int``, or ``None`` which means the size
                       will be the same as that of the input.


   .. py:method:: forward(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor

      Evaluate the adaptive average pool on the input.

      :param x: the input tensor.

      :returns: The pooled tensor.
